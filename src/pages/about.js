        I'm a front end and mobile developer.
        I started my journey as self-taught game developer then transitioned into web and mobile.
        Ever since then I found passion in web and mobile technologies. In my free time, I spend hours honing my skills
        to become a better software engineer. Building new projects and challenging myself to perfect my craft.
